	abstract = {Sharing data assets has emerged among organizations with variable interest, especially in the manner of federation. Blockchain has been used in data sharing systems to provide the audit and access control on data because of its tamper-proof characteristics. However, the user's authority is difficult to accurately describe because of the complexity of users' multidimensional roles in the federation. And when developing the decentralized access control mechanism with the support of blockchain techniques, how to improve the efficiency of the decision for access control is the problem that is necessary to be solved. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based multidimensional user authorization and role-based access control mechanism in the federated data sharing system. The colored coin is defined to identify the user's authority in multidimension, and decentralized access control decision is achieved through the automatic execution of smart contracts, thereby effectively enhancing the mechanism robustness and improving the security decision performance. The system is implemented on the basis of HyperLedger Fabric. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is feasible and efficient. The decision efficiency is remained stable with the increasing of policy rules.},

	abstract = {Federated learning breaks down data silos and promotes the intelligence of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, the principal-agent architecture commonly used in federated learning not only increases the cost, but also fails to take into account the privacy protection and trustworthiness of flexible on-demand data sharing. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a secure and trusted federated data sharing (STFS) based on blockchain. Initially, we construct an autonomous and reliable federated extreme gradient boosting learning algorithm to crack the data isolation problem, providing privacy protection and verifiability. Furthermore, we design a secure and trusted data sharing and trading mechanism to ensure secure on-demand controlled data sharing and fair trading. Finally, the security of STFS is proved based on the universal composable theory. The results of ample experimental simulations demonstrate the good effectiveness and performance of STFS for IIoT applications.},

	abstract = {Frequently described as the oil of the digital economy, data is today fervently sought after and its innovative use demonstrated in increasingly wide-ranging applications. To use data however, data users would first have to find them. In the realm of public / open data, there are often governmental and non-governmental agencies that consolidate and provide such data to users via centralized web portals. However, the equivalent is not available for datasets from the private sector, where data providers currently operate in highly-siloed environments. Data users seeking data but unfamiliar with the industry sector of interest have no straightforward mechanism to do so. This paper proposes Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) - a cloud-based, federated (peer-to-peer-like) dataset discovery platform based on open-source software, which allows for private sector data providers to increase visibility of their datasets to be discovered by unfamiliar data users. We explain the considerations behind the proposed dataset discovery platform and demonstrate it in a real-life pilot implementation.},

This paper presents an administrative tool called CLOUD-CAT to facilitate a flexible, secure, and efficient management of multiple user accesses and multiple access control policies in multi-owner cloud computing environment. CLOUD-CAT is designed and developed based on the integration of Ciphertext Policy-Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) and Role-based Access Control Model (RBAC) access control model. To support policy management, the tool provides secure channel for several data owners to update and administer their access control policies resided at the cloud server.

	doi = {10.1109/LISAT.2014.6845195},
	abstract = {A deployable Emergency Information Sharing (EIS) framework is necessary to facilitate not only the sharing of critical, timely incident information with all responding emergency managers and organizations, but also to remotely command and monitor tactical actions, and communicate multi-media data to all first responders at the incident site. Consistent with the Presidential Policy Directive on National Preparedness (PPD-8), such a framework must “achieve an integrated, layered, and all-of-Nation [capabilities-based] preparedness approach that optimizes the use of available resources”. The resulting real-time, Shared Situational Awareness (SSA) between all emergency response organizations, managers, first responders, and even local citizens, will quickly mobilize and facilitate an effective, coordinated emergency response to minimize risks, hazards, and loss of life. Presented here is an approach to an effective EIS framework for SSA that is readily achievable, cost-effective, sustainable, and deployable in the near-term. Based on commercially available technology and network infrastructure, this proposed framework can achieve (1) federated data sharing among all participating agencies and organizations; (2) selective, shared real-time access to data/video feeds, controlled by each data feed owner; (3) secure, dynamic incident management sessions coordinating all managers and personnel; (4) a cloud solution operational over available network infrastructure; (5) mobile command and SSA on tablets/smartphones; and (6) a persistent, “always on” 24/7/365 solution for day-to-day and emergency operations. A proposed three-pronged approach is presented, using commercially available components, which demonstrates an EIS framework that achieves effective SSA. The EIS design includes (1) utilizing an open standard, data sharing framework, such as the Distributed Data Framework (DDF); (2) deploying on a NextGen Cloud Platform that provides scalable, resilient and reserved performance compute/storage/network access; and (3) leveraging an easy-to-use but powerful, four-dimensional data visualization, command \& control, SSA browser/server system, such as fourDscape®. These three core components working together are crucial for an EIS framework to achieve an all-ofNation, pervasive, shared situational awareness at all levels. The need for “vertical” as well as “horizontal” (i.e. DDF) data sharing is also described, which requires a layered emergency information sharing framework and device mesh that relies more on a machine-to-machine (M2M) communications paradigm, which interestingly begins to touch on the global “Internet of Everything” frontier.},

Moreover, in many cases this data is naturally distributed or has to be shared across multiple institutions requiring decentralized solutions. In this paper, we present a federation approach that can take advantage of advanced cyber-infrastructure (ACI) by seamlessly and securely interacting with information/data located across geographically distributed resources. We describe and evaluate the establishment of a federated marketplace across resources from UK and US in the context of collaborative research in medical imaging. We show how users from different sites can transparently access to remote data by placing computational requests in the marketplace. Moreover, we evaluate different pricing policies to demonstrate how site providers and users can benefit from such federation.},

Their features, e.g., Handling blog entries containing customer needs, can be arranged dynamically by means of bigraphs. Bigraphs encode structure and behavior relations and thus, enable the context-sensitive specification of features.

In such systems it is often the case that users cannot be wholly trusted, and access control conditions need to take the level of trust into account. Most existing work on trust-based access control in web services focuses on a single aspect of trust, like user credentials, but trust often has multiple aspects such as users’ behavior and their organization. In addition, most existing solutions use a fixed threshold to determine whether a user’s trust is sufficient, ignoring the dynamic situation where the trade-off between benefits and risks of granting access should be considered. We have developed a Multi-aspect and Adaptive Trust-based Situation-aware Access Control Framework we call "MATS" for federated data sharing systems. Our framework is built using Semantic Web technologies and uses game theory to adjust a system’s access decisions based on dynamic situations. We use query rewriting to implement this framework and optimize the system’s performance by carefully balancing efficiency and simplicity. In this paper we present this framework in detail, including experimental results that validate the feasibility of our approach.},

This paper presents the results of our efforts to design, develop, test and implement a RL-based decision support platform based on the Open Trip Model (OTM) for the logistics industry. The main contribution of this paper is a potentially generalizable platform architecture and instantiation of the following main functional components: 1) a graphical user interface to access platform services, 2) APIs to automate the data collection based on the OTM, 3) an OTM compliant data storage, 4) a repository and tool for testing multiple algorithms and perform (hyper)parameter tuning, and 5) infrastructure provisioning to run and monitor agents. The platform is complemented with RL guidelines to transfer the platform, knowledge, and practices to SMEs. The platform architecture is validated with a panel of experts and demonstrated in use in a case study at a logistics services provider. The platform demonstration and case study contribute to increasing awareness of potential applications of RL in the logistics industry. The platform provides a foundation for empirical research and experimental development of RL approaches in logistics.

	abstract = {The number of Internet of Things devices is growing dramatically, generating a huge amount of data which is becoming a valuable asset for data analysts. This trend culminates towards the creation of an IoT data marketplace, where streams of data from heterogeneous sources are sent in real time to various data consumers and are metered for monetization purposes. Publish/subscribe systems, such as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), are a promising solution to act as a transport layer for real-time data streams in a decoupled and large scale manner. However, pub/sub systems lack two key properties for an IoT data marketplace: (1) it does not provide any monetization logic; (2) it assumes that the pub/sub brokers are trusted entities, which is not the case in a decentralized or federated marketplace setting. In this paper, we address these issues using a reliable and transparent monetization system based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts. We propose three monetization solutions and demonstrate the trade-off between the overhead of tracking IoT data on a blockchain vs. the accuracy of the monetization for data producers and consumers. In particular, we provide a Bloom filter-based solution for efficient verification of data exchange. We implement our system using Ethereum and Solidity and evaluate with respect to contract gas cost.},

	doi = {10.1109/UCC-Companion.2018.00038},
	abstract = {The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) marketplace has continued to expand in recent years. Although a few major providers dominate (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure), there are also a number of specialist providers offering hosting services and computing platforms. A single Cloud provider can also offer a marketplace for their own offerings - e.g. the AWS Marketplace, which enables third party libraries to be deployed as services within AWS instances. In order to determine whether a particular CSP should be used, clients need to apply preliminary assessment and evaluation when provisioning services on such a provider. Service selection can be realised based on different decision-making criteria, to enable a more informed selection process for clients. Trust can be utilised as a mechanism to inform such selection decisions. Trust can have different representations and utilise parameters derived from past interactions. Trust therefore represents an expression of risk associated with a service exchange between clients and providers. We present a trust-based risk evaluation for CSP selection in federated clouds, with a particular focus on security \& data privacy. We use a scenario from an Architecture, Engineering \& Construction (AEC) project to demonstrate how such a selection can be made, and is of benefit in developing the federated system. A methodology for the selection process is outlined, making use of metrics and certification processes from the Cloud Security Alliance. The proposed approach can also be generalised to other application domains with similar requirements.},

The main element is the ability to share data among all parties while abiding by a data sharing policy. The EPI (Enabling Personalised Intervention) project addresses the problem of personalised diagnosis by developing real-time monitoring services and digital health twins. The EPI services run over adaptive computing infrastructures which provide more flexibility to accommodate the different requests. This paper proposes the EPI framework to support these novel health services over programmable infrastructure. The framework works on aligning the parties' ability to share data with the policy defined beforehand. We explain the approach by introducing the framework's data sharing logic model. We define the formalism of the logic model to deduce feasible data movements between and possibly satisfy a data collaboration request. We reinforce the framework's logic model by introducing the algorithms running on this federated system to simulate its workflow. We provide three healthcare use cases running on a typical EPI infrastructure. We evaluated our model according to three relevant parameters, performance, feasibility, and aggregation power, and we can conclude that our framework supports the required interoperability between the EPI partners.},

	abstract = {Objective: We summarized a decade of new research focusing on semantic data integration (SDI) since 2009, and we aim to: (1) summarize the state-of-art approaches on integrating health data and information; and (2) identify the main gaps and challenges of integrating health data and information from multiple levels and domains. Materials and Methods: We used PubMed as our focus is applications of SDI in biomedical domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to search and report for relevant studies published between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2021. We used Covidence—a systematic review management system—to carry out this scoping review. Results: The initial search from PubMed resulted in 5,326 articles using the two sets of keywords. We then removed 44 duplicates and 5,282 articles were retained for abstract screening. After abstract screening, we included 246 articles for full-text screening, among which 87 articles were deemed eligible for full-text extraction. We summarized the 87 articles from four aspects: (1) methods for the global schema; (2) data integration strategies (i.e., federated system vs. data warehousing); (3) the sources of the data; and (4) downstream applications. Conclusion: SDI approach can effectively resolve the semantic heterogeneities across different data sources. We identified two key gaps and challenges in existing SDI studies that (1) many of the existing SDI studies used data from only single-level data sources (e.g., integrating individual-level patient records from different hospital systems), and (2) documentation of the data integration processes is sparse, threatening the reproducibility of SDI studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Developing models that accurately predict patient's care pathways using prognostic and predictive biomarkers is increasingly important in both clinical practice and scientific research. The main objective of the ATHENA project is to: (1) accelerate data driven precision medicine for two use cases-bladder cancer and multiple myeloma, (2) apply distributed and privacy-preserving analytical methods/ algorithms to stratify patients (decision support), (3) help healthcare professionals deliver earlier and better targeted treatments, and (4) explore care pathway automations and improve outcomes for each patient.

	abstract = {Objective: The objective was to develop and operate a cloud-based federated system for managing, analyzing, and sharing patient data for research purposes, while allowing each resource sharing patient data to operate their component based upon their own governance rules. The federated system is called the Biomedical Research Hub (BRH). Materials and Methods: The BRH is a cloud-based federated system built over a core set of software services called framework services. BRH framework services include authentication and authorization, services for generating and assessing findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data, and services for importing and exporting bulk clinical data. The BRH includes data resources providing data operated by different entities and workspaces that can access and analyze data from one or more of the data resources in the BRH. Results: The BRH contains multiple data commons that in aggregate provide access to over 6 PB of research data from over 400 000 research participants. Discussion and conclusion: With the growing acceptance of using public cloud computing platforms for biomedical research, and the growing use of opaque persistent digital identifiers for datasets, data objects, and other entities, there is now a foundation for systems that federate data from multiple independently operated data resources that expose FAIR application programming interfaces, each using a separate data model. Applications can be built that access data from one or more of the data resources. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The ambition of the EU Data Strategy can be summarized as a ‘federation of interoperable data spaces’. Currently, a multitude of architectures, frameworks and protocols is used by various data spaces. The Data Sharing Coalition has provided an architecture framework for interoperability between data spaces, making use of a harmonization domain and data space proxies as key architecture concepts. Complete interoperability between a wide variety of data spaces presents a challenge for the harmonization domain. To enable interoperability between a variety of data spaces, a set of harmonization profiles are required in the harmonization domain to provide the necessary functionalities. However, implementing each harmonization profile comes with additional complexity. Therefore, it is desirable to identify a minimal set of harmonization profiles to provide interoperability between an adequate variety of data spaces. This paper addresses the identification of harmonization profiles, presents a framework for structuring harmonization profiles and explores the impact of key trust aspects (policy management and trust ecosystem) on harmonization profiles. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

	abstract = {Nowadays, innovative digital services are massively spreading both in the public and private sectors. In this work we focus on the digital data regarding the mobility of persons and goods, which are experiencing exponential growth thanks to the significant diffusion of telecommunication infrastructures and inexpensive GPS-equipped devices. The volume, velocity, and heterogeneity of mobility data call for advanced and efficient services to collect and integrate various data sources from different data producers. The MobiDataLab H2020 project aims to deal with these challenges by introducing an efficient and highly interoperable digital framework for mobility data sharing. In particular, the project aims to propose to the mobility stakeholders (i.e., transport organising authorities, operators, industry, governments, and innovators) reproducible methodologies and sustainable tools that can foster the development of a data-sharing culture in Europe and beyond. This paper introduces the key concepts driving the design and definition of a cloud-based data-sharing federation we call the Transport Cloud platform, which represents one of the main pillars of the MobiDataLab project. Such platform aims to ensure transnational access to mobility data in a secure, efficient, and seamless way, and to ensure that FAIR principles (i.e., mobility data should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) are enforced. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

We also explore specific types of models such as graph networks to model the information in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) collected at hospitals, and we investigate how we might use federated learning to aggregate information such as this across hospitals.

	abstract = {Background: To drive translational medicine, modern day biobanks need to integrate with other sources of data (clinical, genomics) to support novel data-intensive research. Currently, vast amounts of research and clinical data remain in silos, held and managed by individual researchers, operating under different standards and governance structures; a framework that impedes sharing and effective use of data. In this article, we describe the journey of British Columbia’s Gynecological Cancer Research Program (OVCARE) in moving a traditional tumour biobank, outcomes unit, and a collection of data silos, into an integrated data commons to support data standardization and resource sharing under collaborative governance, as a means of providing the gynecologic cancer research community in British Columbia access to tissue samples and associated clinical and molecular data from thousands of patients. Results: Through several engagements with stakeholders from various research institutions within our research community, we identified priorities and assessed infrastructure needs required to optimize and support data collections, storage and sharing, under three main research domains: (1) biospecimen collections, (2) molecular and genomics data, and (3) clinical data. We further built a governance model and a resource portal to implement protocols and standard operating procedures for seamless collections, management and governance of interoperable data, making genomic, and clinical data available to the broader research community. Conclusions: Proper infrastructures for data collection, sharing and governance is a translational research imperative. We have consolidated our data holdings into a data commons, along with standardized operating procedures to meet research and ethics requirements of the gynecologic cancer community in British Columbia. The developed infrastructure brings together, diverse data, computing frameworks, as well as tools and applications for managing, analyzing, and sharing data. Our data commons bridges data access gaps and barriers to precision medicine and approaches for diagnostics, treatment and prevention of gynecological cancers, by providing access to large datasets required for data-intensive science. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {For facility management, photography is an efficient and accurate method of recording the physical state of infrastructure. However, without an effective organizational scheme, the difficulty of retrieving relevant photos from historical databases can become overly burdensome for highly complex or long-lived assets. To make strategic decisions, it is crucial to retrieve the right information from a plurality of sources in a timely manner. The main objective of this paper is to present a method for organizing and retrieving photos from massive facility management photo databases using photo-metadata: photographed location, camera perspective, and image semantic content information. Indoor localization experiments were performed using Bluetooth technology to infer the location information. Perspective is inferred from the device's on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU). Image semantic content is inferred using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning algorithm. Fusing these three features, seven query options were provided for the user when retrieving images. Leveraging Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a process and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a framework, this paper also envisions a federated information management by connecting 2D and 3D facility assets with our real-world map which can be smoothly bridged with our image retrieval system. The realization of the integrated application with BIM and GIS is significantly beneficial for the facility management domain by advancing the understanding of projects in a broader view with a federated data platform. In this research, the framework is illustrated with 21 institutional buildings within the University of Texas at Austin's main campus, and the authors conclude that the proposed metadata-based image retrieval system can ultimately enhance the better-informed decision-making process through rapid information retrieval. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The paper describes a reference architecture for open marketplaces to be used for networked stakeholders in industrial production ecosystems. The motivation for such an endeavor comes from the idea to apply the basic principle of the platform economy to offer functions of an asset “as a service” to industrial production, including the associated supply chain networks. Currently, commercial offers of “production as a service” usually lead to proprietary systems with the risk of platform vendor lock-ins. Hence, there is a need for an open approach that relies upon international (emerging) standards, especially those from IETF, IEC, the Plattform Industrie 4.0 and the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA). The presented approach enables federation of marketplaces according to well-defined interfaces. This article proposes a technology-independent open architecture derived from functional and non-functional system requirements and driven by the idea of the Smart Factory Web, a testbed of the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC). Furthermore, the architecture of the Smart Factory Web (SFW) platform is presented and assessed against the current and future demands of open federated marketplaces for industrial production ecosystems. © 2021 by the authors.

Although an exchange of data between health care providers and other institutions such as cancer registries has already been established in Germany, it does not take advantage of internationally coordinated health data standards. Translational cancer research would also benefit from such standards in the context of secondary data use. This paper employs use cases from the German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) to show how this gap can be closed using a harmonised FHIR-based data model, and how to apply it to an existing federated data platform. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.},

	abstract = {Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) is pervasive and characterized by the rapid growth of IoT platforms across different application domains, enabling a variety of business models and revenue streams. This opens new opportunities for companies to extend their collaborative networks and develop innovative cross‐platform and cross‐domain applications. However, the heterogeneity of today’s platforms is a major roadblock for mass creation of IoT platform ecosystems, pointing at the current absence of technology enablers for an easy and innovative composition of tools/services from the existing platforms. In this paper, we present the Data Spine, a federated platform enabler that bridges IoT interoperability gaps and enables the creation of an ecosystem of heterogeneous IoT platforms in the manufacturing domain. The Data Spine allows the ecosystem to be extensible to meet the need for incorporating new tools/services and platforms. We present a reference implementation of the Data Spine and a quantitative evaluation to demonstrate adequate performance of the system. The evaluation suggests that the Data Spine provides a multitude of advantages (single sign‐on, provision of a low‐code development environment to support interoperability and an easy and intuitive creation of cross‐platform applications, etc.) over the traditional approach of users joining multiple platforms separately. © 2021 by the authors.

The federation of IoT platforms can multiply the benefits obtained by the operation of those systems in an isolated way, as it enables important synergies (e.g., intelligent information sharing, system cooperation, service enhancement). This federation requires the enablement of interoperability between the IoT systems, which represents a major challenge, as systems typically follow very different standards, data formats, semantic models and manners of representing the information. We have provided a technical solution in the frame of ACTIVAGE, a project that aims to federate multiple heterogeneous IoT platforms and systems associated to clusters of AHA Smart Homes in 12 regions across Europe, with the goal to improve the AHA service provided and create the first European AHA ecosystem. Our technical solution allows the enablement of full semantic interoperability across heterogeneous platforms and it has been validated in a test scenario. It enables significant AHA service enhancement within the ACTIVAGE ecosystem, as native applications from one platform could be used indistinctly by all federated platforms. Our solution allows good scalability federating new platforms, with linear and relatively low effort. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Motivation: With the spreading of biological and clinical uses of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, many laboratories and health organizations are facing the need of sharing NGS data resources and easily accessing and processing comprehensively shared genomic data; in most cases, primary and secondary data management of NGS data is done at sequencing stations, and sharing applies to processed data. Based on the previous single-instance GMQL system architecture, here we review the model, language and architectural extensions that make the GMQL centralized system innovatively open to federated computing. Results: A well-designed extension of a centralized system architecture to support federated data sharing and query processing. Data is federated thanks to simple data sharing instructions. Queries are assigned to execution nodes; they are translated into an intermediate representation, whose computation drives data and processing distributions. The approach allows writing federated applications according to classical styles: centralized, distributed or externalized. Availability: The federated genomic data management system is freely available for non-commercial use as an open source project at http://www.bioinformatics.deib.polimi.it/FederatedGMQLsystem/ Contact: \{arif.canakoglu, pietro.pinoli\}@polimi.it Summary: The growth of genomics data over the past decade has been astonishing with many independent consortia and institutes producing and releasing genomics data. we review Federated GMQL, a system for querying distributed genomics datasets across many instance connected through the Web. with respect to its competitors it provides a more complete query language. we review advanced feature of the system that allows to automatically distribute the computation while preserving privacy constraints. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The goal of our project is to support agroecology in terms of carbon farming and biodiversity protection by providing an AI and data streaming platform called Gaia-AgStream that accelerates the adoption of AI in agriculture and is directly usable by farmers as well as agricultural companies in general. The technical innovations we propose focus on smart sensor networks, unified uncertainty management, explainable AI, root cause analysis and hybrid AI approaches. Our AI and data streaming platform concept contributes to the European open data infrastructure project Gaia-X in terms of interoperability for data and AI models as well as data sovereignty and AI infrastructure. Our envisioned platform and the developed AI components for carbon farming and biodiversity will enable farmers to adopt sustainable and resilient production methods while establishing new and diverse revenue streams by monetizing carbon sequestration and AI ready data streams. The open and federated platform concept allows to bring together research, industry, agricultural start-ups and farmers in order to form sustainable innovation networks. We describe core concepts and architecture of our proposed approach in these contexts, outline practical use cases for our platform and finally outline challenges and future prospects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is fast becoming the tool of choice for scalable and reliable analysis of medical images. However, constraints in sharing medical data outside the institutional or geographical space, as well as difficulties in getting AI models and modeling platforms to work across different environments, have led to a 'reproducibility crisis' in digital medicine. Methods: This study details the implementation of a web platform that can be used to mitigate these challenges by orchestrating a digital pathology AI pipeline, from raw data to model inference, entirely on the local machine. We discuss how this federated platform provides governed access to data by consuming the Application Program Interfaces exposed by cloud storage services, allows the addition of user-defined annotations, facilitates active learning for training models iteratively, and provides model inference computed directly in the web browser at practically zero cost. The latter is of particular relevance to clinical workflows because the code, including the AI model, travels to the user's data, which stays private to the governance domain where it was acquired. Results: We demonstrate that the web browser can be a means of democratizing AI and advancing data socialization in medical imaging backed by consumer-facing cloud infrastructure such as Box.com. As a case study, we test the accompanying platform end-to-end on a large dataset of digital breast cancer tissue microarray core images. We also showcase how it can be applied in contexts separate from digital pathology by applying it to a radiology dataset containing COVID-19 computed tomography images. Conclusions: The platform described in this report resolves the challenges to the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable stewardship of data and AI models by integrating with cloud storage to maintain user-centric governance over the data. It also enables distributed, federated computation for AI inference over those data and proves the viability of client-side AI in medical imaging.

	abstract = {This chapter presents the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) concept, technologies and applications used to realise intelligent functions, optimise vehicle performance, control, and decision-making for future electric, connected, autonomous, and shared (ECAS) vehicles mobility scenarios. The concept addresses the convergence of the edge intelligence embedded in the vehicles based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with the cooperative, collaborative intelligence distributed into the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and edge computing infrastructure federated with the hierarchical cognitive processes and analytics in physical, network, infrastructure, and data spaces. IoV integrates and links the ECAS vehicles’ domains with the intra-vehicle networks, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, the processing and cognitive functions provided by federated platforms using the intelligent edge and cloud computing infrastructure. The cognitive transformation of vehicles and the integration of immersive technologies, i.e., virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) combined with intelligent connectivity, IoT, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), digital twins (DTs), data, knowledge, security/privacy requirements and learning platforms provide the technological foundation of IoV allowing for entirely new services, applications, and user experiences. The paper advances the latest architectural concepts for ECAS vehicles. It proposes an IoV 3D multi-layered architecture that combines AI, edge computing and connectivity as part of the functional layers while integrating the system properties and trustworthiness properties into the overall architecture to provide efficient new mobility applications and services. The proposed system of systems concept for IoV applications allows for distributed intelligent functions to be embedded into the edge and cloud infrastructure for ECAS vehicles to provide a computing, processing, and intelligent connectivity continuum for IoV applications and services. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Examples include contact tracing for a contagious disease such as COVID19, maritime search and rescue operations, or creating a collaborative bid for a contract. In such examples, the ability to access data may need to change dynamically, depending on the situation of a mission (e.g., whether a person tested positive for a disease, a ship is in distress, or a bid offer with given properties needs to be created). We present a novel framework to enable situation-aware access control in a federated Data-as-a-Service architecture by using semantic web technologies. Our framework allows distributed query rewriting and semantic reasoning that automatically adds situation based constraints to ensure that users can only see results that they are allowed to access. We have validated our framework by applying it to two dynamic use cases: maritime search and rescue operations and contact tracing for surveillance of a contagious disease. This paper details our implemented solution and experimental results of the two use cases. Our framework can be adopted by organizations that need to share sensitive data securely during dynamic, limited duration scenarios. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in logistics experience practical barriers when trying to use, exchange, share, and exploit real-time data in their operational processes. Such barriers include the abundance of proprietary data formats and schemes, the cost of implementing standards, the lack of trust among partners, the lack of IT expertise, and the uncertainty about benefits and return on investments. This position paper introduces the goal and proposed approach of a recently started research project that aims at lowering these barriers. The core proposition revolves around the application of a federated approach based on the concepts of the International Data Space (IDS). In this paper we present a high level architecture underlying this goal and approach. Two main components of the architecture are discussed in more detail: (1) a connector store, offering connectors to realize data exchange between heterogeneous ICT environments, and (2) an interoperability simulator, to explore collaboration opportunities prior to implementation. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

After introducing the conceptual model and design of the ontology, we explain its implementation on top of standard ontologies as well as the process for its continuous evolution and quality assurance involving a community driven by industry and research organisations.

At that point, sensitive data is exposed unencrypted on the gateway host, thus vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we provide a solution to this weakness of federated architectures by using hardware-assisted trusted computing (TC). We propose an approach where the new Intel's CPU extension, namely Software Guard eXtension (SGX), is exploited to guarantee the trustworthiness of the weakest link - i.e., the gateway - in spite of an aggressive attack model. The validation of our work was realised through the European eHealth infrastructure, namely OpenNCP, that enables cross-border health care and establishes shared practices to implement mechanisms and policies allowing patient data exchange between distinct national eHealth systems.

However, the lack of interoperability and collaboration between platforms will negatively influence their adaptability to support future business cases targeting large-scale and cross-domain IoT deployments. While syntactic and semantic interoperability,as a prerequisite for platform cooperation, has been widely addressed by standardization and research actions, organizational interoperability enabling direct and business-driven interactions between IoT platform owners has so far not been in focus. In this paper we present the interoperability approach pursued by the project symbIoTe that implements a flexible interoperability framework, and put forward its solution for organizational interoperability offering decentralized and secure interworking between IoT platforms-IoT-platform federations. Three main collaboration mechanisms are introduced and elaborated: Management of Service Level Agreements (SLA) between federated platforms, multi-level trust and reputation management, anda bartering mechanism for fair sharing of federated resources. The aforementioned mechanisms are put in place to foster decentralized platform collaboration which has higher potential to be adopted by platform owners compared to centralized approaches. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Advances in genome sequencing and genomics research are bringing us closer to a new era of personalized medicine, where healthcare can be tailored to the individual?s genetic makeup and to more effective diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases. Much of this progress depends on collaborations and access to data, thus, a number of initiatives have been introduced to support seamless data sharing. Among these, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health has developed and operates a platform, called Matchmaker Exchange (MME), which allows researchers to perform queries for rare genetic disease discovery over multiple federated databases. Queries include gene variations which are linked to rare diseases, and the ability to find other researchers that have seen or have interest in those variations is extremely valuable. Nonetheless, in some cases, researchers may be reluctant to use the platform since the queries they make (thus, what they are working on) are revealed to other researchers, and this creates concerns with respect to privacy and competitive advantage. In this paper, we present AnoniMME, a framework geared to enable anonymous queries within the MME platform. The framework, building on a cryptographic primitive called Reverse Private Information Retrieval, let researchers anonymously query the federated platform, in a multi-server setting?specifically, they write their query, along with a public encryption key, anonymously in a public database. Responses are also supported, so that other researchers can respond to queries by providing their encrypted contact details. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

This paper extends value-centric design methodology to multi-actor cases by using game-theoretic principles. Federated systems are represented as a Stag Hunt game where players choose between independent (noncooperative) and federated (cooperative) strategies. Risk arises from the possibility of withdrawn cooperation and can be quantitatively assessed for particular design alternatives with subjective estimates of the probability for cooperation and objective measures such as the weighted average log measure of risk. The value of cooperation can be bounded below by designing for the independent strategy and above by designing for a centralized strategy controlled by a single authority. An application case considers a stylized system value model of a distributed satellite system with two players and symmetric design decisions. Results demonstrate lower and upper bounds to the value of a federated strategy with opportunistic, fixed-cost communication services. Quantitative risk analysis shows the value-maximizing federated design under mutual cooperation carries risk which can be mitigated by more conservative design alternatives with only minor loss of value. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) applies the everything-as-a-service paradigm of Cloud Computing to transportation: a MaaS provider offers to its users the dynamic composition of solutions of different travel agencies into a single, consistent interface. Traditionally, transits and data on mobility belong to a scattered plethora of operators. Thus, we argue that the economic model of MaaS is that of federations of providers, each trading its resources to coordinate multi-modal solutions for mobility. Such flexibility comes with many security and privacy concerns, of which insider threat is one of the most prominent. In this paper, we revise and extend previous work where we classified the potential threats of individual operators and markets of federated MaaS providers, proposing appropriate countermeasures to mitigate the problems. In addition, we consider the emerging case of Cloud-of-Things (CoT) for mobility, i.e., networks of ubiquitous, pervasive devices that provide real-time data on objects and people. Automation and pervasiveness of CoT make an additional attack surface for insiders. In an effort to limit such phenomenon, we present an overlay networking architecture, based on gossip protocols, that lets users share information on mobility with each other. A peculiarity of the architecture is that it both constrains the quality and quantity of data obtainable by insiders, optimizing the routing of requests to involve only users that are able to answer them. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In this context, reliability and security are commonly recognized as nontrivial key technical concerns to be guaranteed, considering the obstacles imposed by the heterogeneity of components and the scale of the system. The scope of this chapter is to determine the requirements to be satisfied in order to provide reliability and security when designing federated large-scale distributed systems. As a concrete case, the chapter focuses on crisis information systems, as they are a typical example of a large-scale federated system, where a common agreement about the requirements to be satisfied in order to assume that a crisis information system is reliable and secure, is missing. Moreover, scarce details are provided to describe the means that available commercial products have applied in order to satisfy the reliability and security requirements, in particular confidentiality, and/or to tolerate the faults that may affect a crisis information system. The chapter surveys the available literature and practice on this topic, and proposes an innovative solution for reliable and confidential crisis information systems in the context of the platform under development within the EU-funded projects named DESTRIERO and SECTOR. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Cloud computing is emerging as a viable platform for scientific exploration. Elastic and on-demand access to resources (and other services), the abstraction of 'unlimited' resources, and attractive pricing models provide incentives for scientists to move their workflows into clouds. Generalizing these concepts beyond a single virtualized datacenter, it is possible to create federated marketplaces where different types of resources (e.g., clouds, HPC grids, supercomputers) that may be geographically distributed, are collectively exposed as a single elastic infrastructure. This presents opportunities for optimizing the execution of application workflows with heterogeneous and dynamic requirements, and tackling larger scale problems. In this paper, we introduce a framework to manage the end-to-end execution of data-intensive application workflows in dynamic software-defined resource federation. This framework enables the autonomic execution of workflows by elastically provisioning an appropriate set of resources that meet application requirements, and by adapting this set of resources at runtime as the requirements change. It also allows users to customize scheduling policies that drive the way resources federated and used. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we study the execution of two different data-intensive scientific workflows in a multi-cloud federation using different policies and objective functions. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, federated healthcare cloud broker architecture is proposed where the independent health service providers can be integrated together to form a large healthcare federation, fulfill the requirements of users by sharing the available resources at different locations with affordable prices and provides Quality of Service (QoS) to all end users. Different trust mechanisms such as Policy based trust; SLA verification trust and reputation based trust are computed to ensure the security and privacy of the users, who accessing the services in the proposed architecture. Service Measurement Index (SMI) attributes suggested by the Cloud Service Index Measurement Consortium (CSIMC) used to calculate trust values of the health provider, based on the calculated trust value, the selection is proposed for the specific request that helps to improve the reliability, security and privacy. To resolve the strict treatment of the differentiated module, a new mechanism is suggested as Patient Turned Queuing Scheduling (PTQS) to resolve the possibility of starvation happening in the existing differentiated modules.

As edge computing and IoT become more prevalent, systems will increasingly consist of cooperating, heterogeneous, distributed, autonomous elements. Architectures for cognitive, collaborative systems are evolving to deal with such complex environments. Concepts from multi-agent systems and autonomic computing are being applied to cope with the scope and breadth of large collections of interacting devices and services. Technologies for security and access control must evolve as well. Policy-based mechanisms are widely used and have been very successful in protecting information and controlling access to systems and services. They tend to rely, however, on a centralized infrastructure and on the automated enforcement of directives. Newer paradigms are being investigated that allow policy structures to be more dynamic and contextual, while still preserving the desired levels of control.

A set of Identity Management Systems exist to deal with these identities, in order to improve users' experience and gain secure access. Today we are faced with a large number of heterogeneous identity management approaches. In our study we treated several systems, among those, we present isolated model, centralized model, federated model and user centric model. The federated system makes proof of it eligibility for the identity management, therefore, we were interested in the federated model, which consist on the sharing of digital identity between different security domains , based on an agreement between the entities in communication. The Federated Identity Management (FIM) faces the problem of interoperability between heterogeneous identity federation systems. This study present a use case of interoperability among SAML and WS-Federation.

	abstract = {Multi-modal travelling is a common phenomenon. However, planning multi-modal journeys is still an unstructured and time-consuming experience for customers: they lose time assembling a comprehensive plan out of disparate data, spread over a multitude of information systems - each corresponding to a different company responsible for one of the legs in the journey. Also transport operators are affected by the sparsity of the transportation market, as they might lose potential customers who could not find or know about their services. In this paper, we propose Mobility as a Service (MaaS) as a solution to such problems. Key element of MaaS is that MaaS operators can aggregate solutions of multiple providers to deliver dynamic, transparent multi-modal travels to their users, who experience transportation as managed directly by a single operator. However, given the volume and sparsity of the transportation market, we argue that MaaS operators cannot rely on one-to-one, custom contracts of usage with single mobility operators. Instead, we envision the creation of platforms that automatise the marketing of services for mobility among many mobility providers. In this work, we detail the required features of a general software platform for such a MaaS market. In particular, we provide a precise definition of MaaS through the MaaS Stack - a tiered view of the components needed by entities to join the MaaS market. Then, through the lens of the MaaS Stack, we elicit the features of an enabling software platform. Finally, to validate our approach, we present a compliant prototype, called SMAll, and discuss its main design choices, among which: i) how SMAll supports the creation of a federation-based MaaS market and ii) how microservices - an emerging architectural style that fosters cohesiveness and minimality of components - enhance flexibility and let the platform and the services of its members efficiently scale according to dynamic demands. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Military networks rely today on federated systems with coalition or cooperation partners. Examples of this kind of military networks are the NATO lead 'Federated Mission Networking' (FMN) project and the US lead 'Mission Partner Enterprise' (MPE). The framework of FMN and MPE are very similar and the development of both frameworks goes hand-inhand. The development and understanding of cyber defense mechanism need to include the importance of the extra challenge that is brought by federating networks. In the attempt to counter the threat, federated networks should form groups of interest, where not only technical information is shared within the group for increased ability to counter intrusions, but also analyzed tactical and operational information and to certain extent intrusion method information. Not all militaries or nations are willing to share information on 'how' they protect their own networks, but as this paper shows, there is a need to share information on current events as well as events that have transpired. The aim of this paper is to present aspects what different participants in a federated or mission network should share and elaborate why this information needs to be shared. The key finding is a set of information categories that should be shared in a federated network. The paper will firstly present a generic overview of Responsive Cyber Defense, also known as Defensive Cyber Operations- Responsive actions in US terminology, and introduce previous findings regarding benefits of incident information sharing. The second part of the paper will examine different generic Responsive Cyber Defense situations in order to exemplify the new need for information sharing in a federated context. The paper concludes with recommendations and suggestions on issues to take into consideration when establishing a federated network, where Responsive Cyber Defense capabilities are incorporated. © 2016 IEEE.},

The European side of the GAAIN initiative (EU-GAAIN) exposes five datasets (4051 subjects from E-ADNI/PharmaCOG, I-ADNI, ARWIBO, EDSD, OASIS) currently hosted in the distributed neuGRID e-infrastructure (www.neugrid4you.eu). EU-GAAIN offers a huge amount of morphological and functional scans, surrogate imaging biomarker values (i.e. 4653 cortical and subcortical volumes), cognitive assessments and biochemical markers (i.e.: 286 CSF values, 235 APOE genotype). GAAIN platform provides 24 datasets (almost half million subjects) that can be explored through a user-friendly interface called “GAAIN Interrogator”. Through the GAAIN web-portal, queries results are displayed in graphs and summary tables providing information to understand trends and discover new evidences. The main objective of the GAAIN project is to build a technology for understanding the underlying mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia through a data-driven approach. All the GAAIN data mapped in a common data schema are federated through the Data Partner Clients (DPC) and a distributed pipeline enactment service that allows the execution of analyses relying on distributed Docker machines. Research efficiency can be increased if neuroscientists will access secure federated platforms from a single point of access.

This chapter will present a series of exemplars for environmental analysis, predictive modelling and planning support systems, particularly, the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN): a federated data platform supporting urban research, design and policy formulation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

	abstract = {Technology has increasingly permeated the educational context making the use of learning objects (LOs) very popular. LOs need to be stored and cataloged so they can be located and retrieved in an efficient manner by both students and teachers. Furthermore, the objects collected in different repositories must be examined individually in order to select which ones best match the user’s needs. The main goal of this work is to propose a model that, prepared to the Web 3.0, enables LO to be used, reused or adapted from heterogeneous environments. To reach this goal the creation of a LO federation is proposed in order to organize various repositories in a hierarchical system. We describe how these objects can be harvested, indexed and retrieved by users from different standard repositories and how to present them to users in different devices. The system was able to index more than 100 thousand Los. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

Establishing these resources requires development methodologies that support internal validation of data extraction and translation processes, sustaining meaningful partnerships, and delivering clear and measurable system utility. We describe findings from two federated data sharing case examples that detail critical factors, shared outcomes, and production environment results. Methods: Two federated data sharing pilot architectures developed to support network-based research associated with the University of Washington's Institute of Translational Health Sciences provided the basis for the findings. A spiral model for implementation and evaluation was used to structure iterations of development and support knowledge share between the two network development teams, which cross collaborated to support and manage common stages. Results: We found that using a spiral model of software development and multiple cycles of iteration was effective in achieving early network design goals. Both networks required time and resource intensive efforts to establish a trusted environment to create the data sharing architectures. Both networks were challenged by the need for adaptive use cases to define and test utility. Conclusion: An iterative cyclical model of development provided a process for developing trust with data partners and refining the design, and supported measureable success in the development of new federated data sharing architectures. © 2016.},

Each system, e.g., a mobile device for accessing a learning management system, can still be operated as a separate system, e.g., displaying the latest feedback from peers, while being run as part of a federated system, e.g., synchronizing a learning group for a tutoring session taking into account individual availability of participants. This type of coupling requires interoperability assurance of systems, in particular federating various devices and cross-over features (e.g., linking learning content to posts on social media platforms) in dynamically evolving environments. We demonstrate the utility of bigraph-based handling of SoS. Abstract relationships allow not only the representation of dynamic interaction but also the re-specification of these systems through behavior adaptations. This abstraction supports cross-system decomposition as well as composition of interaction patterns for the purpose of emergent behavior. We show the potential of this approach orchestrating two distributed and independent systems, with orchestration enabling directly respondence to changes in a federated system's context. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is driving the technology and advances of the Internet and every day it is becoming more popular to talk about IoT systems in multiple domains: Smart Cities, Agriculture, and Industrial Internet, etc. Increasingly, IoT systems will need to interact and be interconnected for offering the always-promoted everything-connected paradigm. Current IoT systems rely on semantic web technologies for integrating data and ensure web services interoperability. However there are yet a gap to ensure semantic interoperability among IoT systems. Most of the existing proposed (open) approaches and solutions lack on formal methodologies for interoperability in technology and standard format of the data. We studied and analyzed most available semantic-based IoT approaches to identify the main requirements hindering IoT semantic interoperability. In this paper, we present SEG 3.0 a methodology to federate, unify and provide semantic interoperability. SEG 3.0 emerges from methodologies for ontology engineering and the idea of unification and federated systems. We propose SEG 3.0 and apply it to Internet of Things (IoT) and particularly on use cases for smart cities as proof of concept. Firstly, we define characteristics required for the methodology. Secondly, we describe the processes and the different formal steps. Thirdly, we provide a proof of concept framework and architecture applying this methodology, thus the benefits of using SEG 3.0 methodology in IoT domains are described. Finally, we demonstrate that the SEG 3.0 methodology is applied to three use cases: (1) the M3 framework to assist developers in designing semantic-based IoT applications, (2) the VITAL EU project for smart cities, and (3) the FIESTA-IoT EU project for IoT semantic interoperability. SEG 3.0 is a formal methodology generic enough to be applied to other domains than IoT and smart cities, since the main benefit of the SEG 3.0 is integrating heterogeneous data and adding value to it to build innovative applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

However, distributed concepts recently seem to have grown in relevance. This paper investigates causes and consequences of an increasing decentralization in order to derive recommendations for future BIA architectures. We have conducted a literature review for identifying relevant application drivers, challenges and building blocks for BIA solutions. The results suggest that particularly Internet of Things (IoT) applications drive federated analytical "ecosystem" solutions. In two case studies from the realm of Advanced Manufacturing we deepen the respective insights. On the one hand, our results underscore the business potential of integrated BIA solutions for IoT applications. On the other hand, the applications introduce a set of particular challenges that can be mapped to DW characteristics, mainly regarding data history, integration, administration, and governance. Based on the results, we project the identified trends into the future and suggest a federated, platform-based solution with "Analytical Atoms".},

	abstract = {Australia invests significant resources in environmental data acquisition, management and publication. Although data are abundant, users are typically hampered by an inability to discover, access and re-use the data. The National Environmental Information Infrastructure (NEII) activity will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of discovering, accessing and re-using environmental data beyond its primary purpose. The NEII is envisioned as a federation of environmental data nodes adopting common standards to create a data infrastructure with an initial focus on nationally significant environmental data. Its primary focus is on the discovery and re-use of national environmental data that is already well-managed, but that currently has limited application beyond its original business purpose. In common with spatial data infrastructures, the NEII encompasses common data models, exchange formats and standard network protocols along with centralised catalogues of uniform metadata descriptions. It also includes standardised models for describing environmental measurements, monitoring sites and methods used to observe the environment to address the unique requirements of environmental information. These architectural elements are more fully described in the NEII Reference Architecture (Bureau of Meteorology, 2014b, www.neii.gov.au). The Bureau of Meteorology is leading the development of the NEII including provision of core coordination and integration infrastructure, as well as the governance and collaboration framework for its development and operation. However its ongoing success is dependent on establishing enduring partnerships with major national environmental information organisations. The NEII Programme is framed around five focus areas including (a) Communication, (b) Engagement, (c) Policies and frameworks, (d) Data management, and (e) ICT build. This paper provides a more detailed overview of one component of the Data Management area regarding the development of the NEII Conformance Framework. Conformance means following established guidelines, specifications and standards or working towards them. A conformance framework is a structured set of guidelines that detail the levels at which a participant provides services that comply with the NEII architecture. The NEII Conformance Framework has been developed to (a) enable partners to set priorities against specific expectations that will jointly lead to developing a sustainable federated environmental information system; (b) enable users of the NEII to rapidly assess the suitability of data for their business needs; and (c) provide a common measurement system to monitor progress in the development of the NEII. The framework adopts a capability maturity model approach to describe the steady improvement required for NEII nodes to progress from a basic data release (experimental data service with limited operational support) to an enduring federated system providing environmental information. The design of the model is informed by other maturity-based approaches for open data such as the Open Data Institute's certification approach (Open Data Institute 2015). The paper also presents a worked example of the conformance framework against the Bureau of Meteorology's Australian Hydrologic Geospatial Fabric NEII data services. The paper concludes with an overview of major learnings from the programme to-date. These relate primarily to reducing the cost of participation in NEII by data custodians given the challenge of delivering data using NEII standards; and developing approaches to better support users to use the portfolio of NEII data given some of the methods of data delivery may be new to non-technical users. The NEII programme has prioritised both these and developed work packages to achieve improvements. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is the state of the art computation paradigm enabling providers to offer computing resources to customers in a pay-per-use fashion. Nowadays public Cloud providers offer similar services within few service models, mainly IaaS and PaaS. Cloud providers give to the user the feeling to dispose of infinite resources, thus having to predict the user requirements in order to provide services with minimal costs, maintaining at the same time high levels of SLAs. In order to achieve this goal, Cloud providers can cooperate together to bring new business opportunities, such as expanding available resources, achieving cost effective asset optimization and adopting power saving policies. Cloud Federation allows different Cloud providers the opportunity to work collaboratively to offer best services to customers and contemporary to improve their productivity. Customers can advantage from Cloud Federation for a larger offer of available services, the capability of price comparison and the removal of vendor lock-in. In this paper we describe a platform that enables the federation of several heterogeneous Cloud Providers to allow the customers choosing and activating Cloud services from a central platform, bringing more attractive price policy to customers. The authors introduce a prototype of Cloud Federation platform based on a central infrastructure tested to manage OpenStack, CloudStack and Amazon EC2 providers, thus allowing the user to select the best services in terms of either technical requirements or price policy and activate them without having to explicitly register to each of the federated providers. The prototype is designed to accept different types of Cloud service models by means of transparent interfaces developed around a billing and a metering module, respectively to bill the service to the customer and to collect information about the health status of the federated platforms. © 2015 IEEE.},

Forecasting data, real time data, and actual positions of shipments, containers, and transport means shared via events have to be harmonized and are expected to improve all types of processes, support synchromodal planning, and improve risk analysis from a compliance and resilience perspective. Technically, several solutions are implemented by organizations and innovations have been validated in so-called Living Labs or demonstrators in various projects. These solutions do not yet provide open systems required for a (global) data pipeline. A federation of solutions is required to construct data pipelines and to support sustainable development of applications on smart devices allowing Small and Medium sized Enterprises to collaborate. This paper proposes a set of platform services and so-called platform protocols to allow interoperability of different platforms for constructing a data pipeline. The proposed services and protocols further extend existing interoperability solutions and services for supply and logistics. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.},

The first is the prefix recommend. We can write shorter queries if we use prefixes because we do not need to write the long IRIs. The second feature is the predicate-based recommendation based on the type of the variable. If a variable is in the query and it has a type condition, then our system recommends further predicates of this type. Our system needs information about the dataset for the recommendation. We can get these information with simple SPARQL queries. The queries run on a federated system.

The scope of this chapter is to determine the requirements to be satisfied in order to provide reliability and security when designing federated large-scale distributed systems. As a concrete case, the chapter focuses on crisis information systems, as they are a typical example of a large-scale federated system, where a common agreement about the requirements to be satisfied in order to assume that a crisis information system is reliable and secure, is missing. Moreover, scarce details are provided to describe the means that available commercial products have applied in order to satisfy the reliability and security requirements, in particular confidentiality, and/or to tolerate the faults that may affect a crisis information system. The chapter surveys the available literature and practice on this topic, and proposes an innovative solution for reliable and confidential crisis information systems in the context of the platform under development within the EU-funded projects named DESTRIERO and SECTOR.},

However, in using such data researchers often encounter hurdles-both technical, such as differing data security requirements, and social, such as the terms of informed consent, legal requirements and patient and public trust. Federated or distributed data networks have been proposed and adopted in response to these hurdles. However, to date there has been little consideration of how FDNs respond to both technical and social constraints on data use. In this Perspective we propose an approach to thinking about data in terms that make it easier to navigate the health data space and understand the value of differing approaches to data collection, storage and sharing. We set out a socio-technical model of data systems that we call the "Concentric Circles View" (CCV) of data-relationships. The aim is to enable a consistent understanding of the fit between the local relationships within which data are produced and the extended socio-technical systems that enable their use. The paper suggests this model can help understand and tackle challenges associated with the use of real-world data in the health setting. We use the model to understand not only how but why federated networks may be well placed to address emerging issues and adapt to the evolving needs of health research for patient benefit. We conclude that the CCV provides a useful model with broader application in mapping, understanding, and tackling the major challenges associated with using real world data in the health setting.},

This paper presents FedFlow, a federated content distribution platform to build infrastructure-agnostic health data sharing and synchronization services to support healthcare dataflows. FedFlow creates secure and efficient data sharing and synchronization patterns for intra-dataflows and inter-dataflows by using implicit parallel data preparation schemes. A prototype of FedFlow was developed to conduct a case study about the building of inter-dataflows for delivering synchronized health data to multiple organizations by using combinations of non-functional requirements algorithms to accomplish governmental rules related to health data management. The experimental evaluation in a multi-cloud federated environment showed that FedFlow is around 90\% faster than a traditional pipeline implementation, around 40\% faster than Jenkins workflow management, and almost 30\% faster than duplicity.},

	abstract = {In this viewpoint, we argue for the importance of creating data spaces for genomic research that are detached from contexts in which fundamental rights concerns related to surveillance measures override a purpose-specific balancing of fundamental rights. Genomic research relies on molecular and phenotypic data, on comparing findings within large data sets, on searchable metadata, and on translating research results into a clinical setting. These methods require sensitive genetic and health data to be shared across borders. International data sharing between the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area and third countries has accordingly become a cornerstone of genomics. The EU General Data Protection Regulation contains rules that accord privileged status to data processing for research purposes to ensure that strict data protection requirements do not impede biomedical research. However, the General Data Protection Regulation rules applicable to international transfers of data accord no such preferential treatment to international data transfers made in the research context. The rules that govern the international transfer of data create considerable barriers to international data sharing because of the cost-intensive procedural and substantive compliance burdens that they impose. For certain jurisdictions and select use cases, there exist practically no lawful mechanisms to enable the international transfer of data because of concerns about the protection of fundamental rights. The proposed solutions further fail to address the need to share large data sets of local and regional cohorts across national borders to enable joint analyses. The European Health Data Space is an emerging federated, EU-wide data infrastructure that is intended to function as an infrastructure bringing together EU health data to improve patient care and enable the secondary use of health-related data for research purposes. Such infrastructure is implementing new institutions to support its functioning and is being implemented in reliance on a new enabling law, the regulation on the European Health Data Space. This innovation provides the opportunity to facilitate EU contribution to international genomic research efforts. The draft regulation for this data space provides for a concept of data infrastructure intended to enable cross-border data exchange and access, including access to genetic and health data for scientific analysis purposes. The draft regulation also provides for obligations of national actors aimed at making data widely available. This effort is laudable. However, in the absence of further, more fundamental changes to the manner in which the EU regulates the secondary use of health data, it is reasonable to believe that EU participation in international genomic research efforts will remain impeded.},

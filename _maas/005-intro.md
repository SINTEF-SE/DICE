The literature analysis aims to get an overview of the state-of-the-art related to federated data sharing. The research questions sought addressed are:
- RQ 1: To what extent is federated data sharing covered in recent research literature?
- RQ 2: Which key concepts and technologies are mentioned in relation to federated data sharing?
- RQ 3: Which application domains are federated data sharing associated with?
- RQ 4: Which challenges and future research directions are described by the literature?

The analysis is performed using a combination of systematic mapping[^1] and bibliometric analysis[^2].

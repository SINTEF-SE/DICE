DICE is a strategic project operated and funded by the department of Software Engineering and Safety at [SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/). The project started with a first phase (DICE 1) in 2020 with the goal of learning more about how digitalisation and associated tooling could support circular manufacturing and production models in order to stimulate sustainable innovation. This project phase brought more knowledge about important concepts and technologies, established contact with several industry clusters as well as research environments within SINTEF, supported project proposal development targeting funding instruments in Norway and EU, and enabled collaboration with existing project initiatives related to digitalisation and circularity. In 2021, phase 2 (DICE 2) was started. In this phase the objective was to apply the knowledge obtained in the first phase and zoom in on specific challenges. One challenge identified in the first phase is that there is a need to stimulate to increased industrial data sharing. This is in line with the European strategy for a European Data Economy. Here, common European data spaces based on a federated data sharing architecture is considered a solution to supporting fair, secure, and sovereign data sharing. On this basis, DICE 2 performed a mixed-method literature analysis aiming to identify and analyse state-of-the-art research related to federated data sharing practices relevant to addressing circular strategies.

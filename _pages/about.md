DICE is a strategic project operated and funded by [SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/). The project started with a first phase (DICE 1) in 2020 with an ambition of learning more about how digitalisation and associated tooling could contribute to the transition from linear to circular models in order to stimulate sustainable innovation. The mandate in this phase was to obtain more knowledge about important concepts, perform networking and apply for research funding in Norway and EU, and employ lessons learned in ongoing research projects. In 2021, phased 2 (DICE 2) was started. In this phase the objective was to further apply lessons learned from the first phase and dig deeper into how different digitalisation strategies and tools could be applied. One lesson was that there is a need to stimulate to increased data sharing. Therefore, DICE 2 performed a mixed-method literature analysis aiming to identify and analyse state-of-the-art related to data sharing practices relevant to addressing circular strategies.
